# GRACC

GRid ACcounting Collector

(pronounced "grok")

---

GRACC is a collection of components for implementing resource usage accounting.

### Why GRACC?

GRACC is meant as a replacement of the Gratia accounting system; the engineering focus is on smaller, independent components rather than a monolithic collector architecture.  The hope is that, by breaking the functionality into a series of smaller components, future architectural changes (such as migration to a new database) can be done without rewriting the entire infrastructure.  For example, forwarding information to a separate accounting database becomes much simpler in this infrastructure.

Repositories of interest:

* [GRACC Collector](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-collector).  An agent which runs on an existing Gratia collector that forwards raw usage records to GRACC.
* [GRACC Monitoring Emails](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-email).  Simple daily emails overview GRACC activity.
* [GRACC Request Agent](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-request). Agents that listen for replay requests from GRACC.
* [GRACC Summary Agent](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-summary). Agents that request summary records from the Request Agent and forward the records back to the Logstash agent for storage in ElasticSearch
* [GRACC Archiver](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-archive).  Agents that listen on the RabbitMQ exchange for raw records and store them to disk in a gzip file.
* [GRACC Backup Scripts](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-backup). A service that runs periodically on the same host as the Archiver which backs up the completed gzip files to external Tape.  See [Backup Docs](dev-docs/backups.md) for more details.
* [GRACC Reports](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gracc-reporting).  A collection of reports that run periodically that query GRACC and present aggregated data to stakeholders.
